# GenBI Database Integration Guide

## Database Successfully Added

The GenBI system now includes a fully functional PostgreSQL database with sample e-commerce data, ready for natural language business intelligence queries.

## Database Overview

### Connection Details
- **Database Type**: PostgreSQL (Neon-hosted)
- **Primary Use**: Development and demonstration
- **Fallback**: Snowflake (if PostgreSQL unavailable)
- **Auto-Configuration**: Environment variables automatically set

### Sample Data Schema

The database contains realistic e-commerce data with the following structure:

#### Tables
1. **customers** (10 records)
   - customer_id, customer_name, email, city, state, country
   - registration_date, customer_segment (Premium/Standard)

   - order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_amount
   - order_status (Delivered/Shipped/Processing), shipping details

4. **order_items** (20 records)
   - order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity
   - unit_price, total_amount

#### Relationships
- customers → orders (one-to-many)
- products → order_items (one-to-many)  
- orders → order_items (one-to-many)

## Sample Business Questions

The database supports natural language queries such as:

### Sales Analytics
- "What are our total sales this month?"

- "What's the profit margin by product?"

### Order Insights
- "How many orders are in each status?"
- "Show me monthly order trends"
- "What's the order fulfillment rate?"
